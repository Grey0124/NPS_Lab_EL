# ARP Spoofing Detection & Prevention System - Project Details

## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** specifically designed for detecting and preventing ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing attacks in local area networks. The system integrates cutting-edge machine learning algorithms with traditional rule-based detection mechanisms to provide robust, real-time protection against network-level attacks.

The system is built on a sophisticated architecture that combines **offline machine learning model training** with **real-time packet processing and inference**, creating a multi-layered defense mechanism. It features a modern web-based monitoring dashboard, comprehensive event management, and extensive logging capabilities, making it suitable for enterprise network security applications.

## Problem Statement

ARP spoofing attacks represent a critical vulnerability in local area networks (LANs) where malicious actors can manipulate the ARP cache of target devices to redirect network traffic through compromised nodes. These attacks can lead to:

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Interception and modification of network traffic
- **Session Hijacking**: Unauthorized access to user sessions
- **Data Interception**: Stealing sensitive information transmitted over the network
- **Denial of Service**: Disrupting network connectivity for legitimate users

### Existing Limitations

Traditional network security solutions suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Limited Detection Accuracy**: Rule-based systems often generate high false positive rates (15-25%) and miss sophisticated attack patterns
2. **Lack of Real-time Processing**: Most existing solutions cannot process network traffic in real-time, leading to delayed threat detection
3. **Insufficient Feature Extraction**: Current systems rely on basic packet analysis without leveraging advanced machine learning techniques
4. **Poor Scalability**: Existing solutions cannot handle high-volume network traffic efficiently (>10,000 packets/second)
5. **Limited Prevention Capabilities**: Most systems focus only on detection without providing prevention mechanisms
6. **Inadequate Monitoring**: Lack of comprehensive real-time monitoring and alerting systems

### Research Objectives

This project addresses these challenges by developing an integrated system that:

- Combines machine learning algorithms with rule-based detection for superior accuracy
- Provides real-time packet processing with minimal latency (<50ms)
- Implements comprehensive feature extraction from network packets
